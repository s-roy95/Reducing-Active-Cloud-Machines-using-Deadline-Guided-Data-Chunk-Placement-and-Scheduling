Running Our approach
- `g++ main.cpp`
- `a.exe 1`      // Generates job 
- `a.exe 2`      // Executes our approach

In order to simulate real life data
- In line `188`, change file name from `trace.txt` to `google.txt` 

In order to simulate synthetic data
- In line `188`, change file name from `google.txt` to `trace.txt`


- `input.txt` and `google_CRED.txt` are the input file for CRED approach, generated in current folder.

- `GOOGLE_ORG.txt` is the raw data that is sliced into `google.txt`
